Overview
-----------------
This is a simple program for a galvanize portfolio.  Its function is to roll a number of dice, of a selected number of sides.  The dice side selections are the commonly used selection in the classical D&D role playing environment. It requests user input for a number of dice to roll, then requests how many times to roll the dice.  It validates these inputs, and generates dice results randomly.  In the case of rolling a 20 the program notifies of a critical hit.
